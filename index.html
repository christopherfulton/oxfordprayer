          <p>Father God, we lift to you our precious city of Oxford, which you have blessed so often in the
          past.<br>
          We thank you for our doctors and nurses, and all health and care workers.<br>
          Please preserve them, keep them safe, and may your life and health flow through
          them to others.<br>
          We thank you for those working in frontline services, from refuse collectors to
          supermarket workers, media providers to delivery drivers. Please bless them as
          they persevere on our behalf. </p>

          <p>We thank you
          for Oxford’s nurseries, schools, universities, and ask for creativity for staff
          teaching online, courage for students, and new ways for every child and student
          to flourish.<br>
          We thank you for scientists seeking to combat this virus through vaccines.
          Please bless their efforts, lead us out of this time of trial, and deliver us
          from evil. </p>

          <p>We thank you
          for all our leaders in Councils, and in government. As they make difficult
          decisions on our behalf, may your Spirit of wisdom lead them in taking
          resourceful and compassionate action.<br>
          We pray for those on the streets and living on the margins, for your provision:
          through kind, practical support, and may all in our city receive our daily
          bread. </p>

          <p>We pray for
          any in danger at home. Please keep them safe, restore broken relationships, and
          breathe your peace upon every household in Oxford.<br>
          May all who are lonely, anxious, or whose minds are troubled, know your
          presence bringing alight and hope. </p>

          <p>Please comfort
          all who are suffering bereavement or loss of any kind today.<br>
          We pray for those facing insecurity or turbulence in their work lives, for your
          guidance, and sustaining grace to carry on.<br>
          We pray again that ancient prayer: Lord: ‘We do not know what to do, but our
          eyes are upon you’. We lift our eyes and hearts to you.<br>
          Please lead us in your good ways, your ancient paths. As Oxford University
          bears the motto, ‘The Lord is my light’, may we know your light, and may we
          carry that light to others.<br>
          May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, Love of God and Fellowship of the Holy
          Spirit be with us all. Now and Forever, Amen. </p>
